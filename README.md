# UpsamplingofPointclouds

Point Cloud is the data obtained from the 3D scanners,this raw data is given to
the Deep Learning architecture called PointNet to classify
the objects into different classes. This model can used for various 3d recognition and
classification tasks.
With help of architectures like PointNet and PointNet++ PointClouds are upsampled.
